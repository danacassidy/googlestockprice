# googlestockprice
A visualization of 'GOOGL' closing price and stock volume made with the streamlit libraries.

I made this during my practice of different data science tools for data visualization. I imported streamlit and yfinance in order to make this app function. If you'd like to view it on the web, download the file, and input "streamlit run stockapp.py" and directions to view the app in your browser will appear.
